In this project we need to create our own game using a library called Minilibx (it's the school graphical library).

They tell us that to succeed in this challenge we must "being rigorous, level up in C programming, use basic algorithms, do some information research".

I believe them; the library it's poorly documented, so we really need to do some researchs.

At the end, the game it's very simple: a 2D world where you control a character that need to get some collectables around the map and then leave the place. The map must be generated automatically accordind to the user parameters.
The main challenge at this game it's do not get losted in your own code. Since the library it's pretty basic and the rules to wrote our code are really tigh, we need to create well organized structs to reach the goal.
